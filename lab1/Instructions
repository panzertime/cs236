OK, we're at the point where the tricky stuff seems to be done.  

Just finishing up the core features and testing edge cases.

Need to do scanners for:

	: and :-
	strings
	IDs

For : and :- :
	Just ask if the next character is a -, I guess.  Otherwise it'll be WS
	and ignorable.  Push to vector using a case or if-else.

For strings:
	Keep going until you get the last ' , adding each new src.get() to a string.
	Then push that string into the vector - might have to add a ' if you do a 
	while(c != '\'').  Even could try a do-while to catch the first ' easily.

For IDs:
	If it's not a number, it's an ID.  Get until the next WS and test for keywords,
	then add to vector.



* NEED TO CHECK FOR NEWLINES IN STRINGS
* GENERAL ERROR CHECK CRAP
