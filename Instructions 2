toString is key:
	parse into DatalogProgram
	DP.toString();
		then toString all of the things *in* DP appropriately

recursive descent:

stepping thru vector of tokens (whew):

	parse[thing](){
		match(terminal)
		match(terminal)
		parse[other var]()
			//nest more parses for that translation
	}

obviously this is too much big-O, so make lotsa functions

really what's going on is you're making a recursive structure to call
	match(tokentype) several times in the right sequence
